## Task 1: Randomly select next action
QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions.
1. *Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? *
 * During my observations (approximately 10 cycles of new target placement), I 
 have observed only 1 case, when the car reached the target.
2. *Are there any other interesting observations to note?*
 * Not very much, the behavior is completely random, so I don't think that there
 is any particular pattern to be found at this stage of the project
